Lab 1a.

	Our read-command.c has two functions to aid the make_command_stream function.
Within our make_command_stream function, the first step is tokenizing the characters
obtained from the stream. operators are simply added to a token array with the
exception of the '&' and '|' characters. Further checks were done to seperate 'or' 
and 'pipeline' as well as 'and' and an invalid character (single ampersand). At this
point we also check to ensure the number of left and right parentheses are equal to
ensure all subshells are complete.
	The first function we added was 'partition'. This function seperates the tokens
by line. Checks for balanced subshells are also included here. The second function we
added was 'parser'. 'parser' was used to ensure each token was valid with respect to
one another. For example, a redirection must be preceded and followed by a word or 
parentheses. If there are no errors found, the 'parser' will then create a command
and feed it to 'partition'. 'partition' combines the commands into a command_stream
and feeds that back into make_command_stream.
	Testing our code with the included test files and our own, the code seems to work.
However, there might have been cases we did not thing of. If there are any problems
encountered, we will fix and add to the file.
